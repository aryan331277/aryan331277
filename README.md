# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Aryan
### ðŸ”¥ First-Year Student | Self-Taught AI Builder  

ðŸš€ Built 52+ projects in just one year â€” from transformers to time series, computer vision to cybersecurity, and even EEG-based brain decoding.  
ðŸŽ¯ Passionate about **AI for good**, **neurotech**, and pushing the limits of what solo builders can achieve.

ðŸš€ Some of my projects feel like Black Mirror episodes â€” bold, futuristic, and a little unsettling (in a good way).
But not all. I also build practical, impactful solutions grounded in real-world needs.
